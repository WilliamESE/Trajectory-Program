The following is a list of features/changes I want to see in the next version of this autonomous program.
Interface:
    Collapsable side panels
    slicker design for side panels
    When it generates the path name is auto added in the hpp header

Field:
    Dynamic sizes, resize the window
    Load different fields: FRC, VRC, IQ, and more
        Define field size
    Zoom function?
    Field pieces

Robot
    Build robot representation and analysis form
    Define sizes, speed, accel, jerk
    Have paths defined under a robot
    Load in different positioning information
    Play through the data with speed controls
        Higher standard will have to defined for data
    Higher dynamic structure different functions can be defined like, shooter, intake, expansion
        There will have to be some options available for these functions, things that are important for the path generation
        Does the robot have to be still?
        How much time does the action take?
        How does it know when to continue, is there a sensor value a function it must call?

Paths
    Select points along bezier curve
        A point on the curve can be selected and the speed, angle.
    Colours will indicate speed up and slow down instead of turns
    Slow down for corners to maximize robot speed
    S-Curve
    Proper accounting for on the spot turns
    Easy to make straightlines

Traversal
    Stall detection
    Tuning functions - Velocity, acceleration, odometry, etc...
    Improved interface
        Generic subsystem setup
    Tuning system
    Testing system
